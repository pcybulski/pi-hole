# List that I use in pi-hole for blocking domains (mainly blocking advertisements ones [youtube, google, google play store])
# So far it is working pretty good. I had one problem with youtube.com being blocked but I just added it to the white list.
# I am running pi-hole on raspberry pi zero W with wireless connection to access point. Ip address for rpi is reserved on access point.
# I've decided not to change settings on the access point, just do it per computer/mobile device (I have more controll over what device is using it, also it is easier to switch it of just for one device).
